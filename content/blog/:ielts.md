I took IELTS Academic test on December 7, 2019 B.C. (I was among lucky ones to take this exam Before Corona ðŸ˜…). It was my second time to take IELTS and both times I did it with the British Council. "Why did you need an IELTS certificate?", you might ask me. Well, the answer is practically all career paths I thought would be good for me required an IELTS certificate. For example, I have always wanted to continue my studies abroad and to get admitted to a masterâ€™s degree in a decent university you need to get at least 6.5 band score. Also, if you have a good band score then from my experience I can tell you that your job interview (I am talking about IT-sphere jobs only, but I am sure that the same rule applies to many other spheres) will end sooner than you might expect (Of course other job-related skills are valued more than your IELTS certificate but still having good band score shows your potential to employers and in my opinion, English is the must-know language for everyone who wants to work in IT sphere).

So the main question is how did I get 8.0 from IELTS? Well, after getting into university the idea of taking IELTS again never came to my mind until I graduated my junior year. When I considered to take IELTS again, I tried to use the service of tutors for preparing for my exam but after several weeks into my training, I concluded that it was of little use to me and that instead I better prepare myself. 

I think if you have a certain level in English (letâ€™s say you know English well enough to get an IELTS score 6.0) and you have decent Googling skills then you can get a high band score (7.5+) by preparing individually. So, I decided to prepare on my own and I registered to IELTS. I had about 3 months until my exam. 

So, how I prepared? First, let me mention when and how I started learning English. After finishing school I had a basic knowledge of English and spent the first year at my Lyceum playing Counter-Strike and fooling around. However, from 2nd year I realised that this was the road to nowhere and I decided that I have to take IELTS. Then, I searched for the tutor and I studied for about one year and was able to achieve an overall 6.5 band score. Fortunately, I was able to get into Inha University in Tashkent and I have to admit while I was studying at IUT my English improved a lot because all courses were taught in English. 

Well, finally we arrived at the most important part of this article. So, I registered to IELTS and decided to prepare by myself. Because I was studying at university, I could not spend much time on preparation. Therefore, I decided to come up with the strategy which was to focus on improving my weak sides (which were Writing and Speaking) and to spend at least 2 hours a day for doing anything related with IELTS. I think most people fail in achieving their goals because as someone said: Â«Most people overestimate what they can do in a day, and underestimate what they can do in a monthÂ». So, keeping this quote in mind I did the following to prepare for each section:

Listening & Reading

Every day I did at least one practise test. If you take IELTS with the British Council, you will have a free access to "Road to IELTS". Personally for me this online resource was very beneficial. I would advise to follow all the advices given there to the letter and use free resources wisely. Also, I used practise sets such as Cambridge, Thompson and some hard ones. My advice is to start doing practise sets which are hard and as the day of your exam approaches to do easier practice sets such as Cambridge. I think that practise sets available in "Road to IELTS" and Cambridge tests are the closest simulation tests to real IELTS exam, so whatever score you get doing your mock tests on those tests you can expect to get the same score in real exam.

Speaking

First thing I did was to check what was the evaluation criteria. Many students prepare for speaking test without carefully checking how their speech will be evaluated. So, my advice is to check the public version of the document (check the very bottom of this post) which shows clearly what aspects of your speech will be evaluated. After I found out evaluation criteria, I started speaking in English with anyone who could speak English and for three months I tried to speak in English as much as possible. Of course, some people in public will frown at you and think that you are showing off but for the sake of your future simply ignore them. 

I improved my speaking a lot by taking past IELTS speaking questions and writing my model answers. Also, there are many model answers you can find on the web. Learn new vocabulary and general answering techniques from good model answers (link to the main resources I used is given at the very bottom of this post).

Writing

Again first thing I did was to check what was the evaluation criteria. Checking how your writing will be evaluated is important. After that, I decided to write at least several essays for each type of Task 1 and Task 2 questions. So, again I found good model answers and tried to imitate their way of writing. 



All in all, preparing and taking the IELTS exam is hard, but I can assure you that if you achieve good score you will have many opportunities you never imagined you would have.
